# 📌 SQL Queries Repository

## 📝 Overview
This repository contains a collection of **SQL practice queries** designed for **interview preparation** and real-world database problem-solving. The queries cover a range of difficulty levels, from basic to advanced, and are written for **SQL Server**.

## 🔍 About the Project
Solving a set of SQL problems using two tables: **users** and **logins**. The key highlights include:
✅ **Designed relational tables** with primary and foreign keys.
✅ **Inserted sample data** for real-world scenarios.
✅ **Explored advanced SQL concepts** like CTEs, window functions, aggregate functions, and filtering techniques to derive meaningful insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL Server** – Database Management System
- **T-SQL (Transact-SQL)** – Query Language
